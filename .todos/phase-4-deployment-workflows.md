# Phase 4: Deployment Workflows - Implementation Plan

## Workflow 4.1: Production Deployment Pipeline (2-3 days)

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create production environment file (.env.production)
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate configuration templates
- [ ] Domain configuration for production deployment
- [ ] Database migration strategy for production

### Docker Production Setup  
- [ ] Multi-stage production Dockerfiles for backend/frontend
- [ ] Health check implementation for all services
- [ ] Container optimization and security hardening
- [ ] Production docker-compose with resource limits

### Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] Structured logging configuration for production
- [ ] APM integration setup (optional: New Relic/DataDog)
- [ ] Log aggregation setup (ELK stack or alternatives)
- [ ] Alert configuration for operational monitoring

## Workflow 4.2: CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement (2 days)

### GitHub Actions Enhancement
- [ ] Comprehensive CI pipeline with security scanning
- [ ] Vulnerability assessment integration
- [ ] Multi-environment deployment automation
- [ ] Docker image building and registry push

### Deployment Automation
- [ ] Blue-green deployment strategy implementation
- [ ] Database migration automation with rollback
- [ ] Staging environment validation workflow
- [ ] Production deployment with approval gates

## Workflow 4.3: Monitoring and Maintenance (2 days)

### Application Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Request performance tracking middleware
- [ ] Business metrics tracking implementation
- [ ] Real-time performance dashboards
- [ ] Intelligent alerting system

### Automated Maintenance
- [ ] Scheduled database cleanup tasks
- [ ] Log rotation and archival automation
- [ ] Performance metric collection system
- [ ] Health check endpoints for all services

## Workflow 4.4: Backup and Disaster Recovery (1 day)

### Backup System
- [ ] Automated database backup with retention policy
- [ ] Configuration backup and versioning
- [ ] Application data backup strategy
- [ ] Point-in-time recovery capability

### Disaster Recovery
- [ ] Recovery procedures documentation

- [ ] Security headers and CORS configuration
- [ ] Secret management and environment isolation
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning and patch management

### Performance
- [ ] Database connection pooling and optimization
- [ ] Caching strategy implementation
- [ ] CDN configuration for static assets
- [ ] Load balancing and scaling configuration

### Operations  
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment capability
